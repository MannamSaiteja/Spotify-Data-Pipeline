# Spotify Data Pipeline using Apache Spark

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Spotify data pipeline using **Apache Spark** and **Databricks**. The pipeline extracts raw data, performs transformations, and loads it into a structured format for further analysis. This pipeline simulates a data engineering process where large volumes of Spotify data are processed to provide insights for decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing engine for big data tasks.
- **Databricks**: Cloud-based platform for managing Apache Spark clusters and collaborative notebooks.
- **Python**: Programming language used for automation and scripting the data pipeline.
- **SQL**: Query language used to aggregate and analyze data.
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage used for raw data input and output of the pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Ingest raw Spotify data files, including song metadata and user interaction data, stored in AWS S3.
- **Data Transformation**: Use Spark DataFrames to clean, format, and aggregate raw data.
- **Data Aggregation**: Perform SQL-based queries to calculate total plays, average listening time per track, and other key metrics.
- **Pipeline Automation**: Fully automated data pipeline using Databricks notebooks to execute ETL processes with minimal manual intervention.
- **Data Loading**: Write the transformed data back to S3 in a structured format for downstream analysis or reporting.

## Instructions to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or Databricks workspace.
2. Install required Python packages:
   - `pyspark`
   - `boto3` (to interact with AWS S3)
3. Set up an **AWS S3 bucket** for storing both the raw input and processed output data.
4. Upload the raw Spotify data (CSV/JSON) to the S3 bucket.
5. Open the provided Databricks notebook and execute the cells to run the entire pipeline.
6. The pipeline will process the raw data, perform transformations, and store the final results in an output directory within S3.

## Project Workflow

1. **Extract**: Raw data, including song and user listening information, is ingested from S3.
2. **Transform**: The raw data is cleaned, duplicates are removed, missing values are handled, and aggregations are applied using Spark.
3. **Aggregate**: Data is aggregated to compute metrics like total plays per track, average listening time, etc., using SQL queries in Spark.
4. **Load**: Transformed and aggregated data is stored back in AWS S3 in a structured format (e.g., Parquet/CSV).

## Future Improvements

- Implement data quality checks to ensure the integrity of incoming data.
- Integrate with real-time data sources using Spark Streaming for up-to-date analytics.
- Enhance the pipeline by adding more complex transformations (e.g., joining with external datasets).
